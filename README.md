# FerrixOX
## Ferrix OS ‚Äì A Secure, Rust-Based Operating System
Ferrix OS is a modern operating system built from the ground up using the Rust programming language, designed with a strong emphasis on security, memory safety, and reliability.

Leveraging Rust‚Äôs powerful ownership model and type system, Ferrix OS aims to eliminate entire classes of common vulnerabilities such as null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflows, and data races. The system is structured to follow Unix-like principles, while introducing modern abstractions and a safe execution environment suited for both embedded and general-purpose applications.

## üîê Key Features:
- Memory-safe kernel written in Rust, minimizing low-level bugs.
- Modular architecture, supporting future expansion for device drivers and userspace components.
- Unix-like structure, familiar to developers and compatible with POSIX-like interfaces.
- Designed for education, research, and security-critical environments.

Ferrix OS is a step toward rethinking operating system development with security and correctness as primary goals‚Äîwithout sacrificing performance or flexibility.
